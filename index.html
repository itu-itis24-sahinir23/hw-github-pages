        <p>Hello I'm Irmak Lorin ŞAHİN. Currently I am a first grade computer engineering student in Istanbul Technical University. Right now, I am mostly learning and 
        working on Data Structures, C/C++ and web development.
        </p>
        <p>While I'm not struggling around my homework,studies or coding I like playing tennis and watching some sports like F1,tennis etc.</p>

        <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Embedded Systems</li>
            <p>Thinking of a system integration of hardware and software that can be created for everyday life gadgets excites me.</p>
            <li>Operating Systems</li>
            <p>I would love to learn the background of computers, how the processes work there, and how a system that is so complex runs without mistakes.</p>
            <li>Cloud Development</li>
            <p>Making data accessible and secure with a system is a field that I would want to dive into.</p>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <p>After the BLG101 class, I find web designing quite creative and logical. Most of the fields in CS focus on being functional, while web development also regards aesthetics, which I find really important.</p>
